#This EEM script monitors an IPSLA for packet loss
#Its purpose is to fail over from the locally managed router to a backup managed by a 3rd party
#When triggered it will shut down the LAN interface
#This removes the router from the local site
#It also stops the local router from sending routing updates for the local LAN
